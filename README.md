# Interactive-Sales-Dashboard
With this dashboard you are able to choose specific customers, the products they bought, and receive information on quantity, sales amount, and product type. This part of the dashboard is catered to a salesman working the company to better meet the needs of the customer, and increase sales potential. In the dashboard there is also a metric that measures sales against budget, to better visualize the overall profits of the company in any given year from the data set.
